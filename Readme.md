The Repo you are veiwing is all of my study notes for my Data Structures and Algorithms exam.
The following Repository will include examples of the following:

## Searching and Sorting Algortithms

- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Shell Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues

Due to this course being taught in C# this year, I will cover linked lists, stacks, and queues implementing the IEnumerable interface.

## Hash Tables

We didn't cover much of hash tables, but there will be an example or two in here somewhere

## Trees

- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- Red Black Trees
- Splay Trees
- 2-3 Tree
- B-Tree
- Pre Order Traversal
- Post Order Traversal

## Time Complexities

I will go over the majority of time complexities in Big O Notation throughout the example programs
